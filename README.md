### About

In Breakout game, a layer of bricks line along the top of the screen and the goal is to "destroy" them all while moving a game paddle on the bottom of the screen. The player should also prevent the ball hitting the bottom line as it results in "Game-Over".

This is an arcade game, originally developed and published by Atari (released on May 13, 1976). It was conceptualized by Nolan Bushnell and Steve Bristow, influenced by the seminal 1972 Atari arcade game Pong, and built by Steve Wozniak.

Developed in a workshop of Epitech Coding-Club Berlin.
Further information about the workshop can be found in the [Documentation.pdf](https://github.com/JohannesTimmreck/Game_CodingClub/blob/master/Documentation.pdf).
